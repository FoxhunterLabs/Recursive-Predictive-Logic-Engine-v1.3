Recursive Predictive Logic Engine — v0.3
----------------------------------------

To run the engine locally:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.
2. Install Flask:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the engine:
   python recursive_logic_engine.py

4. Open your browser:
   http://localhost:5000/

What it does:
- Ingests operational metadata (e.g. safety, delay, crew count)
- Refines prediction accuracy over recursive feedback cycles
- Surfaces novel insights and confidence intervals
- Compounds clarity over time

UI Features:
- Minimalist interface for real-time testing
- Insight preview panel
- Input-driven cycle simulator
- Adaptive engine state visualization

Next Steps:
- Replace mock payloads with live project metadata
- Attach filters and automation logic
- Deploy to team portal or decision center

You’ve just launched the foundation of a recursive intelligence system.
This is clarity, on a loop.
