# 🧩 Recursive Predictive Logic Engine v1.3  
**Self-Refining Insight Framework — "Silent Handoff" Edition**

---

### 🚀 Overview
The **Recursive Predictive Logic Engine (RPLE)** is a fully local, deterministic system that ingests operational metadata, identifies signal from noise, and refines predictions through recursive feedback.  
No external dependencies. No cloud. No mystery — just logic and iteration.

This engine is built for **clarity over complexity**, providing explainable insight loops that evolve autonomously over time.

---

### ⚙️ Core Features
- **Recursive Feedback Loop** — outputs are re-fed into the system to improve pattern detection over each iteration  
- **Novelty Detection** — flags unseen data patterns and adjusts weightings dynamically  
- **Confidence Decay** — older data gracefully loses influence unless reaffirmed  
- **Domain Clarity Mapping** — tracks accuracy impact across cost, schedule, and safety dimensions  
- **Self-Contained Design** — runs entirely on local Python + Flask stack

### 🧠 Summary

This system doesn’t just **predict**.
It **learns**.
It refines itself every loop.
And it never forgets what it learned last time.
